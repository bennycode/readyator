# Readyator

Waits for specified `urls` or `ports` on localhost to be ready before running a supplied command.

## Installation

### npm

```bash
npm install readyator
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add readyator
```

## Usage

### Preface

- Addresses (`ports` or `urls`) must be separated by comma if you want to check for multiple services to be ready ( returning a successful HTTP status code).
- Your `command` must be surrounded by quotes so that it can be properly parsed.
- The default check interval is 1s (1000ms) but can be changed.

### Wait for ports

Command:

```bash
readyator [ports] [command]
```

Example:

```bash
readyator 8080,8081 "npm run start"
```

### Wait for URLs

Command:

```bash
readyator [urls] [command]
```

Example:

```bash
readyator https://www.google.com/,http://localhost:8081/ "npm run start"
```

### Change check interval

Command:

```bash
readyator [urls] [command] [interval_in_millis]
```

Example:

```bash
readyator https://www.google.com/ "npm run start" 5000
```

### Node.js API

You can use `readyator` also through its Node.js API:

```ts
import {runWhenReady} from 'readyator';

await runWhenReady([8080, 8081], 'npm run start');
```

It also supports executing a callback function:

```ts
const callback = () => {
  console.log('System is online!');
};

runWhenReady([8080, 8081], callback);
```

## Development

Here is how you can easily test the `readyator` from your development environment when checking out the code:

```bash
npm start https://www.google.com/ "npm run exit"
```
